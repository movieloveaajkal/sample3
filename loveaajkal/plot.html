<p>In the flashback, it is seen that Raghu and Leena used to meet each other secretly and how Raghu left everything for Leena and moved for her to Delhi, discontinuing his studies to be with Leena. Later one day Zoe walks in on Raghu and a woman, assuming she is Leena, but realizes its not the case. Raghu now Raj reveals that he left Leena, for his own big town fantasies.
